------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

folders that we will get
========================

.next
components (we'll create this folder and this one is going to be where we will create our components)
node_modules
pages ( here it contains two pages 1. _app.js      2.index.js )
public
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Header
=======
  logo
  =====
  now we are desgining the logo here which is a image,
  here in nextjs the optimization is one of the thing which we try to achive and if we will be using the 
  old method of images for nextjs that something going to make the optimization of the react less effective
  so here we will be trying to do something using the nextjs images which will be will optimizte and load
  effectivaly for the same we have need to first import them

  nestjs delivers images in much compresed and optimized way so that's why we always use it, it makes image
  optimzation and server side rendering faster for us.

  import Image from "next/image";
  ********************************
  also we need to config it somewhere so we can defined some set of rules for it at the begining of the page
  something like this, so we can import the images from some of the sites and the domins.

  next.config.js
   so if we take images from some other site or domain basically not from our local system then we have 
   to create a next.config.js file and we have to specifie from where we are taking the data.
   inside it 
      module.exports = {{
              images : {
              domains: ["links.papareact.com"],        //from this page we are taking data which is pictures 
        },
        };

  now once we define that we have need to define props for our image which we are using there
 logo designing
****************
    src="papareact/pd3"
    layout="fill"
    objectPositon="left"
    objectFit ="contain" this is something which will make the aspate ratio stop from changing it will use the 
                          same space but aspect ration will be not changing anymore


now we have to mangae it by adding details to it's parent class
relative flex items-center h-10 cursor-pointer my-auto">
              

also we now need to define the header which will contain all these things so first at all
we are goingt to make it

sticky cause it should always appear at the top it should not get hidden after some time


Header styling
**************
      "sticky   it will keep our header always sticked at the top
        top-0 
         z-50 
         grid 
         grid-cols-3 it will develop our heder in three coloumns  1.logo 2.calander 3.user login or logout 
         bg-white 
         shadow-md  it will make shadow in our file
         py-5       padding 5 in y axis top-bottom padding
         px-5"      padding 5 in x axis left-right padding 
            /* p-5 will give us padding 5 in all direction which is kinda shortuct which we have not used here
               but we can use if we need

        md:px-18  it's a breakpoint which akes our header custmized according to scrren size and full responsive
                  also we can say it's a pre-written media query for us in tailwind



Search Desgining
*****************
  for that we are going to use the heroicons that we need to install for serarch icon
  
  npm install @heroicons/react
  once installed we willl be start using them by serarching there icons and importing that in our page.  

  here it contains two thing 
  1. input element    start your search
  2. search icon      serarch icon


 <div className="flex items-center md:border-2 
                  rounded-full py-2 md:shadow-sm">
 

                {/* where user can type on serarch bar */}
                <input   
                     className="flex-grow  it will push the other element next to it to the end so search will be always in the last of the div and the input 
                                           filed and search icon won't collapse
                               pl-5
                               bg-transparent
                               outline-none    it will make hidden the outline of our input filed and show like there is no border of it.  
                               text-sm 
                               text-gray-600 
                               placeholder-gray-400"
                     type="text"  
                     placeholder="Start your Search" 
                    />
              

  {/* It's going to contain Serarch icon */}
                    <SearchIcon className="hidden 
                     md:inline-flex  h-8 bg-red-400
                     text-white rounded-full p-2 
                     cursor-pointer md:mx-2"/>
                    </div>



{/*this is going to be the right section of the header */}

            <div className="flex space-x-4 items-center justify-end">

              <p className="hidden md:inline cursor-pointer">Become a host</p>

              <GlobeAltIcon className="h-6"/>
              
                  <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 border-2 p-2 rounded-full">
                     <MenuIcon className="h-6"/>
                     <UserCircleIcon className="h-6"/>
                  </div>

here we are using one more div because the other div property is now not valid for that
so we have to defined it once again for these itmes to make them into right direct in one flow

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Banner
===========


  we are here going to design banner 
  first we will take the banner from our site, and we have already defined the site from which we are going to 
  take pic in config.next.js

   let's just import that shit and keep going
   
            <div className="relative h-[300px] sm:h-[400px] lg:h[500px] xl:h-[600px] 2xl:h-[700px]">
                  here abouve we made div relative so according to size of the devices it will make the size of the image
                  and that will make that image more responsive  also we have defined various screen sizes for device to device              

             <Image 
               src="https://links.papareact.com/0fm"
               layout="fill"
               objectFit="cover" it will cover all the space of parent div and react image according to screen sizes
               />
          </div>


          here it will get only applied when the postion would be relative that only we are using the position for it absolute
          if we would have made it without making abosulte it will never show up our text on the image cause
          by default a div is static and relative works with the aboulute so for the relative parrent should be
          a relative.

        <div className="absolute top-1/2 w-full text-center">
           <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg">Not sure where to go? perfect</p>
           <button className="text-purple-500
                              bg-white
                              px-10
                              py-4 padding in x axis -4
                              shadow-md  
                              rounded-full 
                              font-bold 
                              my-3 margin in y axis 3
                              hover:shadow-xl
                             active:scale-90 transition duration-158">
           I'm flexible</button>
        </div>
