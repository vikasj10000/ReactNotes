notes of material ui

installing using yarn and npm both

yarn add  @material-ui/core                     in yarn like npm install we write yarn add
npm install @material-ui/core              

once we have installed the material UI in 
our reactProject we need to import that to use that in our project.


so let's try to import that in our page

import React from "react";
import Button from "@material-ui/core/Button"; like this to import

class App extends Component{
render(){
return(
<div>
<Button varient="contained" color="green"></Button>
</div>
);
}}                             // there are 2 types of varient property  1.outlined  2.contained  

props size= medium, small, large 
also to disable the button we can use disable as the prop
 



To add icon we need to install it how we can do that

for yarn : yarn add @material-ui/icons
for npm  : npm install @material-ui/icons

once we done that we use that by importing in our project
 

import React from "react";
import Button from "@material-ui/core/Button"; like this to import
import saveIcon from "@material-ui/icons/save";

function App() {
return (
  <div>
    <div className="APP">
     <header className="App-header">
       <Button
        startIcon={ <saveIcon />}
        size="large" color="secondary"
        varient="contained"
       >Button</Button>          

     </header>
  </div>

);        we will write the icon name inside startIcon={< iconName/>}
}


there are mainly 5 contained buttons such as 
color primary, secondary, disabled, contained-disabled


text buttons : a button which will react like a text and won't have a backgound color just it 
               be colord in it's text known as the text button.

      <button color="primary">Yahoo</button>
      <butoon color="Google" >Google</button>
       these buttons won't use the propery called varient inside itself



Outlined Buttons : are buttons similar to text buttons but it will contain a colored bodder and 
                   in varient a propery called outlined.

                   <button variant="outlined" color="primary" >TextMe</button>

button with icons : 




ButtonGroup : buttons will be attached to each-other.


<ButtonGroup color="primary" aria-label="outlined primary button group">
  <Button>One</Button>
  <Button>Two</Button>
  <Button>Three</Button>
</ButtonGroup>

<ButtonGroup variant="contained" color="primary" aria-label="contained primary button group">
  <Button>One</Button>
  <Button>Two</Button>
  <Button>Three</Button>
</ButtonGroup>

<ButtonGroup variant="text" color="primary" aria-label="text primary button group">
  <Button>One</Button>
  <Button>Two</Button>
  <Button>Three</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
