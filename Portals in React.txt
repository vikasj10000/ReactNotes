portal is one of the feature which was introduced by react recently in which
we can render our data outside of even root element or we can display that in
adjecnt of HTML "root" element and also we can use the react

so simply it means from one React component we can also create one other root component
and from that first root components we can pass values to other Root value



Where it works?
it uses in creating the modal and also at time when we will have need of 
Jquery even we can use that.

how we can use the portals
1. define the id the portal where we want to use it.

2. to give value to portal we use a function call cratePortal in which we pass 2 values
   the first is html element or any component and the secand the id of portal where it should show up.

3. createPortal is a function of ReactDom so we have to also import this on the page 
   where we are going to create a react protal  
   ReactDOM.createPortal(<>,doucment.getElementById();)

4. we can use that it inside a return and function of React.
